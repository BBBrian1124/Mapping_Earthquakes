# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Challenge ReadME
* Using Javascript, Leaflet and Mapbox we have created an interactive map showing Earthquake data with multiple layers to choose from 
* There are 3 options that can be chosen which specify how the map layer visually looks like (i.e. satelite, street, or dark) as well as 3 options for what data to display (tectonic plate lines, all earthquake data and major earthquake data)
* API calls are made to MapBox https://www.mapbox.com/
